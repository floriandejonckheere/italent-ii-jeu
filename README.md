# Trivial

Trivial is a small web application that mimics Trivial Pursuit's card system. Cards are added with questions and answers, and assigned to a category. When in presentation modes, the cards within a category are shuffled and shown one by one.

## Structure

The application contains predefined categories, but categories can be added and removed at will. These are system-wide.

The application is divided in *sets* which contain *cards*. Each card has a question, a response and a category.
